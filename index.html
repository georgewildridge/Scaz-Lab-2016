      <p>When all is said and done I hope to have the review paper I wrote in preparation for the lab up, my daily, weekly and monthly write ups of what exactly I have done in my time there and the paper, presentation and poster I create. </p>

<p>The first project I am doing with Alessandro and Olivier is using deep learning to recognize letters and digits off <a href="http://www.snapcircuits.net/">snap circuits</a>. I believe this is part of a broader effort within social hierarchical learning but I will confirm later. 
In order to use deep learning I first must build a dataset to train on. That is what I am currently working towards and hope to be doing Wednesday. Until then I am preparing to run Olivier's code in an Ubuntu virtual machine. A lot of today was spent downloading and installing the necessary programs. However, after I finished I had run out of space in my virtual machine, a problem that is taking a lot longer than I expected to solve.  Tomorrow I plan to run Olivier's code which segments the image between the pegs. I spent a couple of hours looking through it today and figuring out which code does what and what dependencies his code has.<br>
In the future I hope to take the segmented images and train a neural net on them using the <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/">Tensorflow</a> library.</p>
