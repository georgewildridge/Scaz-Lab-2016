  "body": "This is being edited.\r\n\r\nI am using this page as a resource to document my work leading up to, in and preceding my third summer in the [Social Robotics Lab](http://scazlab.yale.edu/). The finalized version of this document should be completed by the end of November 2016 with five deliverables: a review paper that demonstrates my work leading up to the lab, a daily blog detailing my work while in the lab and a final paper, presentation and poster that wrap up my work and my results while in the lab.\r\n\r\n#Preparation\r\nThe main aspect of this section will be the review paper I wrote in preparation for the lab. I will also outline some of the work I did leading up to this paper including the papers I read and the lectures I watched. I hope to get all of this up in the near future. (todays date: 6/14/16) \r\n#Working in Scaz Lab\r\n\r\n###6/13/16\r\nThe first project I am doing with Alessandro and Olivier is using deep learning to recognize letters and digits off [snap circuits](http://www.snapcircuits.net/). I believe this is part of a broader effort within social hierarchical learning but I will confirm later. \r\nIn order to use deep learning I first must build a dataset to train on. That is what I am currently working towards and hope to be doing Wednesday. Until then I am preparing to run Olivier's code in an Ubuntu virtual machine. A lot of today was spent downloading and installing the necessary programs. However, after I finished I had run out of space in my virtual machine, a problem that is taking a lot longer than I expected to solve.  Tomorrow I plan to run Olivier's code which segments the image between the pegs. I spent a couple of hours looking through it today and figuring out which code does what and what dependencies his code has.  \r\nIn the future I hope to take the segmented images and train a neural net on them using the [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) library.\r\n\r\n###6/14/16\r\nAfter a few hours trying to figure out how to expand the virtual machine I ended up making a mistake which caused a blank black screen after opening. Frustrated, I decided to start over and created a far larger virtual machine that should be very difficult to fill. After re-downloading all the programs and setting things up again I ran into this issue with opencv when I tried to run the code:\r\n\t\r\n\tcv2.error: -------src-dir-------/opencv-2.4.10/modules/highgui/src/window.cpp:501: error: (-2) The function is not implemented. Rebuild the library with Windows, GTK+ 2.x or Carbon support. If you are on Ubuntu or Debian, install libgtk2.0-dev and pkg-config, then re-run cmake or configure script in function cvShowImage\r\n\t\r\nUnfortunately I downloaded opencv using standard the built in library within ubuntu so I could not find a way to make the change it called for without compiling from source. So following the advice on [this page](\r\nhttp://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1916062) I began following [this tutorial](\r\nhttp://www.samontab.com/web/2014/06/installing-opencv-2-4-9-in-ubuntu-14-04-lts/) which did not fully compile on my first pass through the tutorial. At 6:30 I called it quits and I plan on picking it back up tomorrow.\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n###6/15/16\r\nOn my way to work today I ate it on my skateboard and hurt my wrist pretty bad. Although I thought I would be fine, upon arriving at the lab there was a huge lump below my thumb and I was having a lot of difficulty moving my hand and my fingers. Worried I broke my wrist I decided to go get xrays and see a doctor. Luckily, I came away without a break and  just a bad sprain. I'll know more next Wednesday about the severity of the injury. As a result of all of this (and the network being down at my house) I was unable to get work done today.\r\n\r\n###6/16/16\r\nPicking up where I left off Tuesday, I continued with the tutorial. After getting through only about 20% of the install I decided that my issue must have been in my installation of cmake. So I reinstalled cmake from source before lunch following [this tutorial]( \r\nhttp://askubuntu.com/questions/610291/how-to-install-cmake-3-2-on-ubuntu-14-04). It worked until I ran into another error around 76% which I was able to circumvent using [this tutorial](\r\nhttps://gist.github.com/melvincabatuan/8dc300531e84822d368c). Finally, I was able to install opencv; however, when I ran Olivier's code I again received the same error. Currently I am unsure how to continue and I figure I will just try to run this code on another machine.\r\n\r\nAlessandro also took some time to show me how to use [Baxter](http://www.rethinkrobotics.com/baxter/)  today. Here are some important commands that I need to remember:\r\n\r\n\t3989  cd ros_devel_ws/\r\n\t3990  catkin_make\r\n\t3991  rospack profile\r\n\t3992  source devel/setup.bash \r\n\t3993  rospack profile\r\n\t3994  ls src/\r\n\t3995  roslaunch snap_circuits board_calibrator.launch \r\n\t3996  history\r\n\t\r\nImportantly I am using a different set of code then I was using before called boardcalibrator. This code defines the edges of the board and manipulates the image of the board the computer sees independent of the camera angle. **Picture of before and after as well as a general picture of the setup of experiment**.  My goal for tomorrow is to be able to run the code with the camera. \r\n\r\n###6/17/16\r\nI made progress today but was not able to run the code with the camera and I will have to get around to it Monday. Today revolved around installing and learning to work with [ROS Indigo](http://wiki.ros.org/indigo). This entails going through the tutorials. My goal is to figure out how to run the command\r\n\r\n\troslaunch snap_circuits board_calibrator.launch\r\n\t\r\nRunning it require a good amount of file configuration so that is what I have spent my day doing. My prospective schedule is as follows: by the end of Monday I hope to have begun building the dataset through taking pictures of each piece, I will most likely devote all of Tuesday to taking these pictures, the beginning of Wednesday will be applying Olivier's code to the photos I took, the end of Wednesday will be devoted to learning to work with TensorFlow and ensuring the ability to apply it to the small dataset Olivier has already built. It is highly probable that my work with TensorFlow will spill into Thursday but hopefully I can get through it Wednesday. Optimistically, however, I would then go on to classifying all the photos I took Tuesday on Thursday and the first half of Friday before training a neural net on the data Friday. Monday would then be devoted to merging it with Olivier's code and ensuring its function on Baxter along with beginning a formal write-up of the project to ensure I understand the motivations of the project as a whole. Pessimistically, this whole process takes until Tuesday or even Wednesday. I hope this is not the case however. \r\n###6/20/16\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n#My Research and Results\r\n\r\n#Conclusion\r\n",
