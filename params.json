I believe this is part of a broader effort within social hierarchical learning but I will confirm later. \r\nIn order to use deep learning I first must build a dataset to train on. That is what I am currently working towards and hope to be doing Wednesday. Until then I am preparing to run Olivier's code in an Ubuntu virtual machine. A lot of today was spent downloading and installing the necessary programs. However, after I finished I had run out of space in my virtual machine, a problem that is taking a lot longer than I expected to solve.  Tomorrow I plan to run Olivier's code which segments the image between the pegs. I spent a couple of hours looking through it today and figuring out which code does what and what dependencies his code has.  \r\nIn the future I hope to take the segmented images and train a neural net on them using the [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) library.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n#Write Ups\r\n\r\n#Conclusion\r\n",
